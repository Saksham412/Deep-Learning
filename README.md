# Deep Learning Notes

## 1. Deep Learning vs Machine Learning

```
|                            Deep Learning                                      |                    Machine Learning                                     

| Works primarly on Neural Networks                                             |   Works on Stastical data and interpretation                

| Works Well with Large Data                                                    |   Works well  with smaller data

| ANN(Basic), RNN(Text and speech), CNN(Image), GAN(Generative data)            |   Regression and Classification with stastical tools and models

| Extracts relevant features progressively                                      |   Features have to be provided|(Can think with and example)

| Takes more time to train                                                      |   Takes less time to train

| Need more hardware power for computation                                      |   Releatively easier to compute

| Not intrepretable as it extracts features on its own we cant give the reason  |   Interpretable as majorly stastics is used
